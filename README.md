here you can store tasks that you want to do and sort them by priority,  in the web there is a option to change or edit the task you also can delete tasks or mark them as finished when you finish them. if you want to access specific task you have a search input that you can type there. another cool thing is that you can click "enter" key to add your tasks .and there is a light mood and dark mode in the web . and the most imoportent thing is that all the tasks that you add will saved at jsonbin. also the web suitable  to your phone.
in the header the user can see how much task he have left to do and if he marks tasks as done it will decrease  the count.
